#Codeschool-Babel-and-Gulp

_This is a follow-along of the [Codeschool tutorial on building a simple Forum App, using ES2015, Babel and Gulp](https://github.com/codeschool/WatchUsBuild-ForumAppWithES2015)._

###Background

ES2015 is an update to Javascript.  Not **all** browsers are able to compile these changes to Javascript (this tutorial is about a year old, but at the time of this writing, Chrome does).  To ensure your code compiles properly across all browsers, you may want to use a _transpiler_ like [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/).  Babel will take your ES2015 code and transpile it into a version of Javascript (ES5) that has cross-browser compatibility.  [**Gulp**](http://gulpjs.com/) is a tool that you can use to automatically tell Babel what to transpile.  


###Getting Set Up

1. Make sure that you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) installed and [up to date](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#updating-npm).

2. Install **`babel-cli`** globally
3. Install **`babel-preset-es2015`** locally in your project folder
